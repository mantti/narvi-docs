<h1>Welcome, researchers!<a class="headerlink" href="#welcome-researchers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Welcome to Aalto, researchers.  Aalto has excellent resources for you,
but it can be quite hard to know of them all.  These pages will provide a
good overview of IT services for researchers for you (focused on
computation and data-intensive work, including experimental work).</p>
<p>These aren&#8217;t generic IT instructions - ITS has an introduction for
staff somewhere (but apparently not online).  There is also a handy list of
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.aalto.fi/en/services/it-services-for-research">research-focused services</a> provided which compliments this.</p>
<div class="section" id="aalto-service-units">
<h2>Aalto service units<a class="headerlink" href="#aalto-service-units" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Understanding all the Aalto services can be quite confusing.  Here are
some of the key players:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Department IT</strong>: Only a few departments (mainly in SCI) have their
own IT staff.  Others have people such as laboratory managers which
may be able to provide some useful advice.  Known links: <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.aalto.fi/display/CSdept/IT">CS</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.aalto.fi/display/NBE/IT+Information">NBE</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.aalto.fi/display/TFYintra/PHYS+IT">PHYS</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.aalto.fi/display/mathintra/Computer+Instructions">Math</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Science-IT</strong>: Overlaps with SCI department IT groups.  They run the
Triton cluster and support scientific computing.  Their services may
be used throughout the entire university, but support is organized from
the departments which fund them.
The core Science-IT departments are CS, NBE, and
PHYS.  Science-IT runs a weekly <a class="reference internal" href="../news/garage.html"><em>SciComp garage</em></a>, where we provide hands on support for anything
related to scientific computing.
<a class="reference internal" href="../index.html"><em>This site (scicomp.aalto.fi)</em></a> is the main home, but
there is also an <a class="reference external" href="http://science-it.aalto.fi/">formal site</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Aalto IT Services (ITS)</strong>: Provides central IT infrastructure.
They have a &#8220;Services for Research&#8221; group, but it is less
specialized than Science-IT. ITS may be the first place to
contact if not in the School of Science.  Their infrastructure is
used in all schools including SCI, and the base on which everyone
builds.  Their instructions are on <a class="reference external" href="https://aalto.fi/it">aalto.fi</a>, but most importantly the already-mentioned
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.aalto.fi/en/services/it-services-for-research">IT Services for Research</a> page.  Contact via <a class="reference external" href="https://it.aalto.fi/contact">servicedesk</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Aalto Research Services</strong>: Administrative-type support.
Provides support for grantwriting, innovation and commercialization,
sponsored projects, legal services for research, and research
infrastructures.  (In 2019 a separate &#8220;innovation services&#8221; split
from the previous &#8220;research and innovation services&#8221;).</li>
<li><strong>CSC</strong> is the Finnish academic computing center (and more).  They provide a
lot of basic infrastructure you use without knowing it, as well as
computing and data services to researchers (all for free).  <a class="reference external" href="https://research.csc.fi/">research.csc.fi</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Also, currently Aalto has information scattered on websites
everywhere:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://aalto.fi">aalto.fi</a> is the normal homepage, but doesn&#8217;t
have much practical information for researchers.  As of late 2018,
information from inside and into is supposed to move here.  The new
site is well known for being hard to use (sorry, we can&#8217;t do
anything about that).  This site is &#8220;not designed to have a logical
structure and instead, you are expected to search for information&#8221;
(actual quote).  Some pages get more information if you log in, and
there is no indication of which ones.  In general, unless you know
what you are looking for, don&#8217;t expect to find anything here without
extensive work.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://inside.aalto.fi">inside.aalto.fi</a> is the <em>former</em> typical
&#8220;official&#8221; staff documentation area, but now gone since 2019 with
all information moved to aalto.fi.  It wasn&#8217;t in search engines, but
once you found a page it wasn&#8217;t easy to find other information.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://into.aalto.fi">into.aalto.fi</a> is the student official
information.  It used to contain a lot of duplicate information to
inside but was public, so people would end up there.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.aalto.fi">wiki.aalto.fi</a> is obviously the Aalto
wiki space.  Anyone can make a space here, and many departments&#8217;
internal sites are here.  Searching can randomly find useful
information.  Most sites aren&#8217;t publically searchable.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="../index.html"><em>scicomp.aalto.fi</em></a> is where you are now.  Scicomp
was started by the Science-IT team from the Triton (HPC cluster)
documentation, and scicomp is slowly taking over from our
departments&#8217;
research IT instructions.  Now it is our general guidance to
researchers and the best place to find information on research and
scientific computing - as opposed to general &#8220;staff computing&#8221; you
find other places.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="end-user-systems">
<h2>End-user systems<a class="headerlink" href="#end-user-systems" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Aalto provides computers to it&#8217;s employees, obviously. Wherther it is
an Aalto wide managed system or standalone depends on your department
policies.  If it&#8217;s standalone, you are on your
own.  If managed, login is through your Aalto account.  You can get
laptop or desktop, and Linux, Mac, or Windows.</p>
<p>Desktops are connected directly to the wired networks and are
typically preferred by researchers using serious data or computation.
<a class="reference internal" href="linux.html"><em>Linux
desktops</em></a> have fast and automatic access to all of
the university data storage systems, including Triton and department
storage.  They also have a wide variety of scientific software already
available (and somewhat similar to Triton).  We have some limited
instructions and pointers to the main instructions for <a class="reference internal" href="mac.html"><em>mac</em></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="windows.html"><em>windows</em></a> computers.</p>
<p>Managed laptops are usable in and out of the Aalto networks.</p>
<p>On both managed desktops and laptops you can become a &#8220;primary user&#8221;
which allows you to install needed software that is found from the
official repositories. Additionally, in some cases, Workstation
Administrator (wa.) account can be given which close to normal
root/Administrator account with some limitations. The &#8220;primary user&#8221;
is widely accepted and recommended by Aalto ITS to all users while
wa. accounts are regulated by the department policies or Aalto ITS.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="computing">
<h2>Computing<a class="headerlink" href="#computing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Having a valid Aalto account you have two primary options: workstations and Triton.  The
Aalto workstations have basic scientific software installed.  From the
workstations, you can use the <a class="reference internal" href="htcondor.html"><em>HTCondor</em></a>
distributed computing framework.</p>
<p>Most demanding computing at Aalto is performed on <a class="reference internal" href="../triton/index.html"><em>Triton</em></a>, the
Aalto high performance computing cluster.  It is a fairly standard
medium-sized cluster, and
it&#8217;s main advantage is the close integration into the Aalto
environment: it shares Aalto accounts, its data storage (2PB) is
also available on workstations, and has local support.  If
you need dedicated resources, you can purchase them and they can be
managed by Science IT team as part of Triton so that you get dedicated resources
and can easily scale to the full power of Triton.  Triton is part of
the Finnish Grid and Cloud Infrastructure.  Triton is the largest
publically known computing cluster in Finland after the CSC clusters.
Triton provides a web-based interface via <a class="reference internal" href="../triton/apps/jupyter.html"><em>JupyterHub</em></a>.  To get started with Triton, <a class="reference internal" href="../triton/accounts.html"><em>request
access</em></a>, check the <a class="reference internal" href="../triton/index.html#tutorials"><span>tutorials</span></a>
sequence, and you&#8217;ll learn all you need.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://csc.fi">CSC</a> (the Finnish IT Center for Science) is a
government-owned organization which provides a lot of services, most
notably huge HPC clusters, data, and IT infrastructure services to the academic
sector.  All of their services are free to the academic community
(paid directly by the state of Finland).  They also coordinate the
Finnish Grid and Cloud Infrastructure.  They have the largest known
clusters in Finland.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="data">
<h2>Data<a class="headerlink" href="#data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Data management isn&#8217;t just storage: if data is just put somewhere, you
get a massive mess and data isn&#8217;t usable in even 5 years.  Funders now
require &#8220;data management plans&#8221;.  Thus data management is not just a
<em>hot</em> topic, it&#8217;s an <em>important</em> one.  We have a <a class="reference internal" href="../data/index.html"><em>whole section
on data</em></a>, and also there are higher level <a class="reference external" href="http://www.aalto.fi/rdm">guides from
Aalto</a>.  If you just want to get something done, you
should start with our <a class="reference internal" href="aaltodata.html"><em>Aalto-specific guideline for Science-IT
data storage</em></a> (used in CS, NBE, PHYS) - if you follow our
plan, you will be doing better than most people.  If you have
specific questions, there is an official service email address you can
use (see the Aalto pages), or you can ask the Science-IT team.</p>
<p>Aalto has many data storage options, most free.  In general, you
should put your data in some centralized location shared with your
group: if you keep it only on your own systems, the data dies when you
leave.  We manage data by <em>projects</em>: a group of people
with shared access and a leader.  Groups provide flexibility,
sharing, and long-term management (so that you don&#8217;t lose or forget
about data every time someone leaves).  You should request as many
projects as you need depending on how fine-grained you need access
control, and each can have its own members and
quota.  You can read about the <a class="reference internal" href="aaltostorage.html"><em>storage locations available</em></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="../data/datapolicy.html"><em>storage service policy</em></a>.</p>
<p>Triton has 2PB of non-backed up data storage on the high-performance
Lustre filesystem.  This is used for large active computation
purposes.  The Triton nodes have an incredible bandwidth to this and
it is very fast and parallel.  This is mounted by default at
Science-IT departments, and can be by default in other departments
too.</p>
<p>Aalto provides &#8220;work&#8221; and &#8220;teamwork&#8221; centralized filesystems which are
large, backed up, snapshotted, shared: everything you may want.
Within the Science-IT departments, Science-IT and department IT
manages it and provides access.  For other schools/departments, both
are provided by Aalto ITS but you will have to figure out your
school&#8217;s policies yourself.  It&#8217;s possible to hook this storage into
whatever else you need over the network.  (In general, &#8220;work&#8221; is
organized by the Aalto hierarchy, while &#8220;teamwork&#8221; is flatter.  If you
consider yourself mainly Aalto staff who fits in the hierarchy, work
is probably better.  If you consider yourself a research who
collaborates with whoever, teamwork is better.)  <a class="reference external" href="https://www.aalto.fi/en/services/file-storage-space-for-research-and-groups-teamwork">Teamwork
instructions</a></p>
<p>CSC provides both high-performance Lustre filesystems (like Triton)
and archive systems.  <a class="reference external" href="https://research.csc.fi/">CSC research portal</a>.</p>
<p>In our <a class="reference internal" href="../data/index.html"><em>data management section</em></a>, we provide many
more links to long-term data repositories, archival, and so on.  The
<a class="reference external" href="https://fairdata.fi/">fairdata.fi</a> project is state-supported
and has a lot more information on data.  They also provide some
data storage focused on safety and longer-term storage (like <a class="reference internal" href="../data/ida.html"><em>IDA</em></a>), though they are not very used at Aalto because we provide
such good services locally.</p>
<p>Aalto provides, with Aalto accounts, <a class="reference external" href="https://it.aalto.fi/instructions/google-drive-registration-and-closing-account">Google Drive</a>
(unlimited, also Team Drives), <a class="reference external" href="https://it.aalto.fi/instructions/aalto-dropbox-quick-guide">Dropbox</a> (unlimited), and
<a class="reference external" href="https://it.aalto.fi/instructions/onedrive-quick-guide">Microsoft OneDrive</a> (5TB).  Be aware that once you leave
Aalto, this data will disappear!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="software">
<h2>Software<a class="headerlink" href="#software" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Triton and <a class="reference internal" href="linux.html"><em>Aalto Linux workstations</em></a> come with
a lot of scientific software installed, with in the <a class="reference internal" href="../triton/tut/modules.html"><em>Lmod system</em></a>.  Triton generally has more.  If you need
something, it can be worth asking us first to install it for
everyone.</p>
<p>If you are the primary user of a workstation, you can install Ubuntu
packages yourself (and if you aren&#8217;t, you should ask to be marked as
primary user).  If you use Triton or are in a Science-IT department,
it can be worth asking Science-IT about software you need - we are
experts in this and working to simplify the mess that scientific
software is.  Windows workstations can have things automatically
installed, check the <a class="reference internal" href="windows.html"><em>windows page</em></a>.</p>
<p>Triton and Aalto workstations have the central software available,
currently for laptops you are on your own except for some standard
stuff.</p>
<p>On Triton and Linux workstations, type <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">module</span> <span class="pre">spider</span> <span class="pre">$name</span></code> to
search for available software.  We are working to unify the software
stack available on Triton and Aalto workstations so that they have all
the same stuff.</p>
<p>ITS has a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.aalto.fi/en/services/university-software-licenses">software and licenses</a> (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.aalto.fi/fi/palvelut/yliopiston-ohjelmistolisenssit">FI</a>)
page, and also a <a class="reference external" href="https://inside.aalto.fi/display/ITServices/University+software+licenses">full list of licenses</a> (broken link,
missing on new page).  There is
also <a class="reference external" href="https://download.aalto.fi/">https://download.aalto.fi/</a>.</p>
<p>CSC also has <a class="reference external" href="https://research.csc.fi/software">a lot of software</a>.  Some is on CSC computers, some
is exported to Triton.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="starting-a-project">
<h2>Starting a project<a class="headerlink" href="#starting-a-project" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Each time you start a project, it&#8217;s worth putting a few minutes into
planning so that you create a good base (and don&#8217;t end up with chaos
in a few years).  We don&#8217;t mean some grant, we mean a line of work
with a common theme, data, etc.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Think about how you&#8217;ll manage data.  It&#8217;s always easy to just start
working, but it can be worth getting all project members on the same
page about where data will be stored and what you want to happen to
it in the end.  Having a very short thing written will also help a
lot to get newcomers started.  The <a class="reference internal" href="../data/plans.html"><em>&#8220;practical DMP&#8221; section
here</em></a> can help a lot - try filling out that A4 page
to consider the big sections.</li>
<li>Request a data group (see above) if you don&#8217;t already have a shared
storage location.  This will keep all of your data together, in the same
place.  As people join, you can easily give them access.  When
people leave, their work isn&#8217;t lost.<ul>
<li>If you already have a data group that is suitable (similar
members), you can use that.  But there&#8217;s no limit to the number of
projects, so think about if it&#8217;s better to keep things apart earlier.</li>
<li>Mail your department IT support and request a group.  Give the
info requested at the bottom of <a class="reference internal" href="../data/outline.html"><em>data outline page</em></a>.</li>
<li>In the same message, request the different data storage
locations, e.g. scratch, project, archive.  Quotas can always be
increased later.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="training">
<h2>Training<a class="headerlink" href="#training" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Of course you want to get straight to research.  However, we come from
a wide range of backgrounds and we&#8217;ve noticed that missing basic
skills (computer as a tool) can be a research bottleneck.  We have
constructed a <a class="reference internal" href="../training/index.html"><em>multi-level training plan</em></a> so
that you can find the right courses for your needs.  These courses are
selected by researchers for researchers, so we make sure that
everything is relevant to you.</p>
<p>Check our <a class="reference internal" href="../training/scip/index.html"><em>upcoming training page</em></a> for a list of upcoming courses.
If you do anything computational or code-based at all, you should
consider the twice-yearly <a class="reference external" href="https://coderefinery.org/">CodeRefinery</a>
workshops (announced on our page).  If you have a Triton account or do
high-performance computing or intensive computing or data-related
tasks, you should come to the Summer (3 days) or Winter (1 day)
kickstart, which teaches you the basics of Triton and HPC usage (we
say it is &#8220;required&#8221; if you have a Triton account).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="other-notes">
<h2>Other notes<a class="headerlink" href="#other-notes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Remember to keep the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.aalto.fi/en/services/it-services-for-research">IT Services for Research page close</a>
close at hand!</p>
<p>Research is usually collaborative, but sometimes you can feel
isolated - either because you are lost in a crowd, or far away from
your colleagues.  Academic courses don&#8217;t teach you everything you need
to be good at scientific computing - put some effort into working
together with, learning from, and teaching your colleagues and you
will get much further.</p>
<p>There are some good <a class="reference external" href="https://users.aalto.fi/~darstr1/cheatsheets/">cheatsheets</a> which our team
maintains.  They are somewhat sepcialized, but useful in the right
places.</p>
<p>It can be hard to find your way around Aalto, the official campus maps
and directions are known for being confusing confusing.  Try
<a class="reference external" href="https://usefulaaltomap.fi">UsefulAaltoMap</a> instead.</p>
