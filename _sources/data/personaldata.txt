Personal data and GDPR
======================

.. note::

   This page is in development and has little content so far.  This
   information should probably be moved somewhere else, but only
   hasn't because there is no other home yet.

The GDPR
--------

* The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) exists to reign in
  some of the recent large-scale abuses of
  personal data.
* Takes effect from May 25, 2018
* It affects all uses of personal data, but.

Resources
---------

* `Aalto data Protection guide
  <https://docs.google.com/document/d/15vmpgw7CecvcoJCuDQSmh3d9ePCp6So-_6KtkuQjiUU>`__

  * Written by Richard Darst, kept up to date with the latest
    understanding within Aalto.  It is long and detailed so currently
    suitable for those who want excessive details.  Please leave
    comments there - they will be acted upon.

* Research ethics committee

   Code of Conduct for science
   ---------------------------
   * link
   * GDPR gives you right to use data for science.  But subjects should
     always have right to control how the data affects them themselves.
   * Separate consent for research from consent from data storage (if you
     go with storing data for purposes of scientific research).  If
     people withdraw, they can request their data be anonymized.

   Procedures at Aalto
   -------------------

   * Be aware that procedures are needed.  Tell others, send them to this
     page before they start a project.
   * Ethics committee application (core of bureaucratic process)
   * Use allowed locations (document on inside)
