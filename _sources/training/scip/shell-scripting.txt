==================================
March 2020 / Linux Shell Scripting
==================================

Part of :doc:`Scientific Computing in Practice <index>` lecture series at Aalto University.

**Audience:** employees and students, intermediate or advanced level
in Linux/Mac shell.  (We happily accept public attendance, but are
doing limited advertisement right now - if the course was advertised
to you, welcome.)

**About the course:** You know that SLURM batch script is a regular BASH shell script mostly? You know that when you login to Triton (our computer cluster) your terminal is a fully enabled shell scripting environment? Do you know how to create an alias, a function, how to use loops and traps in a shell? How to work with variables and arrays? The course is oriented on those who want to start using BASH programming fully and use terminal efficiently.

We expect that course participants are familiar with the :doc:`shell basics <linux-shell-basics>` (experience with BASH, ZSH, etc). We somewhat touch the  :doc:`Part 1 of the Linux Shell tutorial </training/linux-shell-tutorial>`, and continue to Part 2. Though we expect that participant knows how to create a directory and can edit file from the linux shell command line. We will be scripting a lot, there will be lots of demos and real practicing.

**Lecturer:** Ivan Degtyarenko, D. Sc., Science IT / Department of Applied Physics, Aalto University

**Setup instructions:** For the online course we expect you to have Zoom client installed on your local workstation/laptop. Then we expect you to have access to Linux-like shell terminal, means that either you have a Linux/Mac laptop.  For Windows, we will provide installation instructions for git-bash, or you should install a SSH client installed for accessing any of Linux server (kosh/lyta etc at Aalto). If needed participants can be provided with access to Triton for running examples.  *More information upcoming*
