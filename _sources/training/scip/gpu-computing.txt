Sept 2019 / GPU Computing in Practice
=====================================

Part of `Scientific Computing in Practice <https://scicomp.aalto.fi/training/scip/index.html>`__ lecture series at Aalto University.

**Audience:** Employees and students looking for the extensive intro into GPU computing.

**About the course:** The course covers the different models of GPU computing, such as basics of compiling and running GPU ready applications, using GPU libraries to do the math and finally writing your own code with CUDA.

**Lecturer:** Filippo Federici, D. Sc., Department of Applied Physics, Aalto University

**Time, date:** all four lectures in September 2019:

- Thu 12.9 klo 12:00-15:00
- Tue 17.9 klo 12:00-15:00

**Cost:** Free of charge for FGCI consortium members and Aalto employees, students.

**Registration:** `open for the registration <https://www.webropolsurveys.com/S/3933BB03C478419B.par>`__

**Credits (opintopisteet):** Credits available for the Aalto students and course certificate can be provided on request for the outsiders. Since the main focus of the course is learning through experience, the students will be required to perform simulations for homework and hand in result report. Credits/certificate require full time participation and ahndling assignments. Full course hours correspond roughly to 1 ECTS.

**Other comments:** Participants will be provided with access to Triton for running examples. Participants are expected to bring their own laptops. We will use SSH for Triton connection. One can follow the theoretical part without a laptop, though if you want to try the tutorial you’d better have one.
