Science-IT training courses
===========================


Science-IT puts on various training courses, mainly at the C (HPC)
level.  Our guests sometimes put on specialized courses at the B or D
level, too.  Our past courses, including material, can be seen on `the
Science-IT training page <https://scicomp.aalto.fi/training/scip/index.html>`__.

Our courses are not yet split into modules with separate pages, but
our existing modules are roughly as follows.  To find slides, look at
the past few summer kickstarts on `the training archive
<http://science-it.aalto.fi/scip/>`__, for example `2017
<http://science-it.aalto.fi/scip/kickstart2017/>`__:

   * * Linux shell

       B10, B20
     * Introduction to the Linux environment and shell up to advanced
