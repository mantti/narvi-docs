========================
SciComp powerusers group
========================

The **Scientific Compupting powerusers group** is a every-two-weeks
event focused on scientific computing and research software at Aalto.
It is for anyone who wants to be more involved in computing
infrastructure and computing/software/data support at Aalto.

The ideal attendee is a researcher who is more involved in the
programming/technology/data side of things and ends up supporting
others more than usual.  You will get to network with Aalto staff,
learn from them, and discuss your needs.  It will help both your
current research and future career prospects.

The powerusers group is run by Aalto Scientific Computing (Science-IT) in
collaboration with others at Aalto.  Aalto SciComp is in the School of
Science, but serves the whole university - and we explicitly invite
others from other schools to join.
