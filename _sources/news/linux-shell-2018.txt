Linux shell, 2018
=================

**Audience:** employees and students looking for an introduction to the
Linux command line or more extensive intro into BASH scripting.
:doc:`Level B <../training/index>`.


**About the course:** Did you know that a SLURM batch script is a regular BASH
shell script?  Did you know that when you login to Triton your
terminal is fully enabled shell scripting environment? Do you know how
to create an alias, a function, how to use loops and traps in a shell?
How to work with variables and arrays? The course is oriented on those
who want to use terminal efficiently, which will make *all*
computational research easier.

We will start with somewhat basics like files and permissions
gradually growing the complexity of theory and exercises up to writing
advanced scripts.
