Aalto rates overleaf as for "public" data.  This doesn't mean that
Overleaf makes your data public, but just that Aalto can't promise
security.  In reality, you decide if Overleaf is secure enough.  If
there is some legal requirement for security, you probably shouldn't
use Overleaf.  If there is a collaborator requirement for security,
then you must make your own choice if Overleaf is suitable.
