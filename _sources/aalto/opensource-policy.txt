Open Source Policy
==================

Covered work
^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Software

#. Publications and other writing (Note that especially in this case,
   it is common to sign away full rights.  This is a case where you do
   more than this policy says.)

#. Data

Conditions for limited commercial potential
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This policy supports the release of work with limited commercial
potential. Work with commercial potential should be assessed via Aalto’s
innovation process.

#. If work’s entire novelty is equally contained in academic
   publications, there is usually little commercial value. Examples:
   code implementing algorithms, data handling scripts.

#. Similarly, work which only is a byproduct of academic publications
   or other work
   probably has limited commercial value, unless some other factor
   overrides. For example: analysis codes, blog posts, datasets, other
   communications.

#. Small products with limited independent value. If the time required
   to reproduce the work is small (one week or less), there is likely
   not commercial value. For example: sysadmin scripts, analysis codes,
   etc. Think about the time for someone else to reproduce the work
   given what you are publishing, not the time it took for you to create
   it.

#. Should a work be contributing to an existing open project, there is
   probably little commercial value. For example: contribution to
   existing open-source software, Wikipedia edits, etc.

#. NOT INCLUDED: Should work contain patentable elements or have
   commercial potential, this policy does not apply and it should be
   evaluated according to the Aalto innovation process. Patentable
   discoveries are anything which is a truly new, non-obvious, useful
   inventions. In case of doubt, always contact Innovation Services!
   Indicators for this category: actually novel, non-obvious, useful,
   and actually an invention. Algorithms and math usually do not count,
   but expressions of these can.

#. NOT INCLUDED: Software designed for mass-market consumption or
   business-to-business use should be evaluated according to the Aalto
   innovation process. Indicators for this category: large amount of
   effort, software being a primary output.

Ownership of intellectual property rights at Aalto
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. This policy covers work of employees whose contracts assign copyright
   and other intellectual property rights of their work to Aalto.
   However, the Aalto rules for ownership of IP are *extremely*
   difficult, so see the last point.

#. Your rights are assigned to Aalto if you are funded by external
   funding, or if there are other Aalto agreements regarding your work.

#. If neither of the points in (2) apply to you AND your work is
   independent (self-decided and self-directed), then according to Finnish
   law you own all rights to your own work. You may release it how you
   please, and the rest of this policy does NOT apply (but we recommend
   reading it anyway for valuable advice). Aalto Innovation Services can
   serve you anyway.

#. Rather than figure out the the ownership of work, this policy is
   written to apply to *all* work, so that you do not need to worry
   about this.

Release criteria and process
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. This policy applies to copyright only, not other forms of
   intellectual property. Should a work contain other intellectual
   property (which would not be published academically), this policy
   does not apply. In particular, this policy does not cover any work
   which contains patentable inventions.

#. The employee and supervisor must consider commercial potential. The
   guidelines in the “conditions for limited commercial potential” may
   guide you. Should there be commercial potential, go through the
   existing innovation disclosure processes. In particular, any work
   which may cover patentable inventions must be reported first.

#. If all conditions are satisfied, you, in consultation with your
   PI, supervisor, or project leader (whichever is applicable) and any
   funder/client requirements, may choose to release the work. Should
   the supervisor or PI have a conflict of interest or possible conflict
   of interest, their supervisor should also be consulted.

#. Depending on funding sources, you may have more restrictions on
   licensing and releasing as open source. Project proposals and grant
   agreements may contain provisions relevant to releasing work openly.
   When making project proposals, consider these topics already. When in
   doubt, contact the relevant staff.

#. To be covered under this policy, work must be licensed under a
   open/open source/free software license. In case of doubt, Creative
   Commons, Open Source Initiative, and Free Software Foundation
   approved open source licenses are considered acceptable. See below
   for some license recommendations.

#. All warranty must be disclaimed. The easiest way of doing this is by
   choosing an appropriate license. Practically all of them disclaim
   warranty.

#. All authors must consent to the release terms.

#. The employee should not transfer an exclusive license or ownership to
   a third party. Aalto maintains the right to relicense and use
   internally, commercially, or re-license should circumstances change.

#. Employees should acknowledge their Aalto affiliation, if this
   possible and within the community norms.

#. This right should not be considered Aalto officially releasing any
   work, but allowing the creators to release it in their own name.
   Thus, Aalto does not assume liability or responsibility for work
   released in this way. Copyright owner/releaser should be listed as
   the actual authors.

#. Employees are responsible for ensuring that they have the right to
   license their work as open source, for example ensuring that all
   included software and data is compatible with this license and that
   they have permission of all authors. Also the release must be allowed
   by any relevant project agreements. Should you have any doubts or
   concern, contact Innovation Services.

To apply this to your work, first receive any necessary permissions.
In writing, by email, is sufficient. Apply the license in your name,
but list Aalto University as an affiliation somewhere that makes
sense. Do not claim any special Aalto approval for your work.
