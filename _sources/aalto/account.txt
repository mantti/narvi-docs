Extension to Aalto account and email
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Aalto account expiration is bound to staff or student status. Account closes one week after the affiliation to Aalto university ends. Expiration is managed completely by Aalto IT Services, and department IT staff is not able to extend Aalto accounts.

If extension to account is needed, this may be achieved with visitor contract. The contract requires host information, so you should contact your supervisor who (if accepting your request) contacts HR with needed details to prepare the official visitor contract.
