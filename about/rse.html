<h1>Research Software Engineers<a class="headerlink" href="#research-software-engineers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>In 2020, Aalto Scientific Computing is trialing a Research Software/Data
Engineer (RSE) program to improve the quality of our scientific
computing and data use.  &#8220;<a class="reference external" href="https://rse.ac.uk/who/">Research software engineer</a>&#8221; is a recent
term for a longstanding role: someone that works at the interface of
research and software development, but not fully either.  We think
this applies equally to data.</p>
<p>A basic service is provided for certain departments, and an dedicated
service for groups who provide their own funding.  Departments/school
and groups can co-fund the program to gain a dedicated share.</p>
<p>This is the hands-on compliment our training programs, mainly
<a class="reference internal" href="../training/scip/index.html"><em>scientific computing in practice sessions</em></a> and
<a class="reference external" href="https://coderefinery.org">CodeRefinery</a>.  If you want a kickstart
to put those sessons in practice, this is for you.  Attendance
in these courses is useful but by no means required.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">If you are in Aalto, please take <a class="reference external" href="https://forms.gle/wxnCpCGxdUfGGqfw6">our survey</a> to express interest
(necessary to secure funding) and/or request a consultation.</p>

<h2>For researchers<a class="headerlink" href="#for-researchers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You program or analyze data in your daily work, and you know something is missing:
your code and data is less organized, less efficient, less managed than others,
and it&#8217;s affecting the quality of your work.  Or maybe you don&#8217;t know
how to start your project, or publish it.  You&#8217;re too busy with the
science to have time to focus on the computing.</p>
<p><strong>Basic service:</strong> You can apply to the Research Software/Data Engineer
(RSE) program for support and mentorship.  One of our trained RSEs
will work with you for a short period to begin or improve your
project.  The goal is not just to do it for you, but to show you by
example so that you can do it yourself later.  Typical basic tasks
include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Setting up a project in version control with all the features.  This
also includes version control of data.</li>
<li>Preparing code or data for release and publication</li>
<li>Creating or automating a workflow, especially those processing data
or running simulations</li>
<li>Optimizing some code - both for speed and/or adaptability</li>
<li>Efficiency storing data for intensive analysis.  Data replication
and management.</li>
<li>Making existing software more modular and reusable</li>
<li>Help properly using, for example, machine learning library
pipelines, instead of hacking things together yourself</li>
<li>Setting up automatic software testing</li>
<li>Transforming projects from individual to collaborative - either
within a group, or open source.</li>
<li>Generalized &#8220;code clean-up&#8221; which takes a project from development
to stabilized</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dedicated service:</strong> Our RSEs may also provide
programming-as-a-service for specific projects.  Normally, this would
be for larger projects which need long-term support and maintenance,
including those which just want a service and not necessarily to learn
how to do it themselves.  As part of this service, one can get:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Developing or maintaining specific software, services, demos, or
implementations.</li>
<li>Software development as a service</li>
<li>Software support that lasts beyond the time frame of a single
student&#8217;s attention</li>
<li>Adding features to existing software</li>
</ul>

<h2>For RSE candidates<a class="headerlink" href="#for-rse-candidates" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Do you like coding and research, but don&#8217;t want an academic career
path with publications as your sole purpose?  Be a Research Software
Engineer with us!  Our pilot is designed to bridge the gap between
academic research and a future career in research software or a
research scientist in a company.</p>
<p>If (some of) the following apply to you, you are a good candidate:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I like the academic environment, but don&#8217;t want to focus just on
making publications.</li>
<li>I am reasonably good at some programming concepts, and am eager to
learn more.  I know one language well, can shell script, and
generally familiar with Linux.</li>
<li>I am interested in going to a scientist-developer kind of role in a
company, but need more experience before I can make the transition.</li>
</ul>
<p>We strongly prefer good computational researchers (PhD level
preferred) who can improve their software development skills than the
other way around.  This role can be combined with other roles, but
note that this is not targeted to those who intend to follow a
tenure-track academic career path.  New RSEs will get a training
period which rounds out any missing skills.  They will also be
involved in a complete support package: they will have the chance to
be involved in teaching an infrastructure development.</p>

<h2>Already an (underground) RSE at Aalto?<a class="headerlink" href="#already-an-underground-rse-at-aalto" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>RSEs have been an essential part of science for ages, but hardy ever
recognised.  We have many here at Aalto.  Aalto SciComp is trying to
make a community of these people.  By taking part, you can</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Network with others in similar situations and discover career
opportunities.</li>
<li>Share knowledge among ourselves (maybe have relevant training, too)</li>
<li>Take part in developing our services - basically, be a voice of the
users.</li>
<li>More directly help the community by, for example, directly updating
this site, helping to develop services, or teaching with us.</li>
</ul>
<p>Join <a class="reference external" href="https://list.aalto.fi/mailman/listinfo/rse">our RSE mailing list</a> to be kept up to date.</p>

<div class="section" id="for-funders">
<h2>For funders<a class="headerlink" href="#for-funders" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Our pilot is funded by departments and schools, and members of these
units can receive the basic services free of charge (in accordance to
the shares of funding).  If a research group would like dedicated
advanced services (see list above), they can directly fund this
program.  This could be, for example, co-funding salaries or</p>
<p>Benefits to schools/departments:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Increase the quality of efficiency of your research.  Your
researchers focus on their science while improving their coding
skills passively.</li>
<li>Provide hands-on technical research services to your community at a
higher level than basic IT.</li>
</ul>
<p>Benefits to groups:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Receive staff/on-call software development expertise within your
group, without having to fund or hire a full-time.</li>
<li>Your RSEs get joint training and share competence within our RSE
group.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="implementation">
<h2>Implementation<a class="headerlink" href="#implementation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>(draft)</p>
<p>Basic services:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Researchers are selected based on an light application and
consultation or recommendation from Science-IT.  The RSE program
balances its time in proportion to its funding from
schools/departments/groups.</li>
<li>Ranking criteria includes potential to create lasting improvement of
skills within a research group, improvement in hardware efficiency,
number of people benefited, buy-in of group leader, open nature of
projects (we have a preference for open projects which can serve as
an example to others), potential for high-impact open software, and
diversity considerations.</li>
<li>Typical time frame is generally between one day and a week.</li>
<li>General timeframe: initial consultation to discuss starting point,
discussion to decide on target state, RSE provides advice on
additional training, co-working on the project, follow-up advice as
needed.  RSE will ideally work from the same office as the
researcher.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dedicated service:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>All parameters as agreed in funding discussions.</li>
<li>Can be implemented as co-funding of salaries or usage fees.</li>
<li>Time frame typically months or more.  Can include long-term
maintenance or support at a small full-time equivalent.</li>
