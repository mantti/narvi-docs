<h1>Data storage services available<a class="headerlink" href="#data-storage-services-available" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This page provides a list of common data storage services, and can
help you select the right service for the type of data you have (see
<a class="reference internal" href="organization.html"><em>Data organization</em></a>).  But before we talk about services, you have to
consider what your needs are.</p>
<div class="section" id="types-of-data">
<h2>Types of data<a class="headerlink" href="#types-of-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are different broad categories of data:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Code/papers</strong> <strong>drafts/</strong>: These are absolutely critical, but quite
small. You want a full history that is easy to use, too. Put in
version control and in Aalto gitlab.</li>
<li><strong>Original data:</strong> Your original, irreplaceable data. You want this
in two places: a fast, large, available place for day-to-day work,
and also somewhere backed up for a fairly long time.</li>
<li><strong>Intermediate working files:</strong> This is what you get when you run
code on original data. It&#8217;s OK if this is lost, because you have the
code and original data to re-create it, right? It can go in the
large, fast location.</li>
<li><strong>Final published results/data:</strong> You want this backed up and
available for a very long time (forever?). Put in an open-access
repository such as Zenodo.  Once it&#8217;s in the archival, backups
should be done there.</li>

<p>There are different qualities we want in filesystems: large, fast,
confidential, highly available, backed up, mounted everywhere, lasts
forever. It is expensive to have all of these together, so there are
different places with different benefits. It is up to you to balance
their use so that you can accomplish what you need. Compare this table
to the types of data above. Use the right place for the right data.</p>
<p>You often need to use different types of services, for example

</li>
<li><p class="first">Aalto has <strong>work</strong> and <strong>teamwork</strong> storage systems.  These are

</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Aalto laptops</strong> are not a good place to store data because they are

network drives.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Aalto webspace</strong> can share data.  See
<a class="reference internal" href="../aalto/aaltostorage.html"><em>Data storage</em></a>.  This isn&#8217;t suitable for archival or
long-term anything, since it is tied to user accounts.  If you
want to share here, maybe you could do a bit more work and
handle it forever at Zenodo?</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><a class="reference external" href="https://version.aalto.fi">https://version.aalto.fi</a> is the Aalto Gitlab.  It is used for small
version controlled files.  It is a great place for day to day work
of private files, but not for permanent archival.  See
<a class="reference internal" href="../aalto/git.html"><em>Aalto Gitlab</em></a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>ACRIS</strong> is the Aalto &#8220;research information system&#8221;, meaning it&#8217;s a
record of things that everyone is doing research-wise.  You should
make records for datasets there as a research output.
(<a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.aalto.fi/display/ACRIShelp/ACRIS+and+research+data">ACRIS + research data instructions</a>)</p>
<p>Summary: try to host the actual data elsewhere, but always make a
report of the data in ACRIS so you get credit.</p>
<p>ACRIS has support for storing data itself, but that isn&#8217;t
recommended most of the time since ACRIS in it&#8217;s current form isn&#8217;t
guaranteed to stay around forever.  However, if data needs to be
kept internal, it might be OK since you can set confidentiality and
share with certain people.  However, you <em>should</em> always make a
report of your datasets in ACRIS even if they are hosted elsewhere,
so that you can get academic credit for it.</p>
<p>What data sets should be included in ACRIS?  We think: a) anything that
is independently published with DOI. b) any paper which serves as a
formal dataset description in a data journal, even if there is also
an entry as an ACRIS article.  c) any paper which serves as an
informal dataset description.</p>
<p>As for different roles: creator=who is involved in creating it,
distributor=who can be contacted about access (if not public),
owner=who has ultimate responsibility (often the PI but project
dependent).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Eduuni</strong> is a Finnish service for educational collaboration.  It&#8217;s
reported to be more secure than either Google Drive or OneDrive, but
we know of few people who use it.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The <strong>Aalto Wiki</strong> is sometimes mentioned as a place to store data.
It&#8217;s really better for collaboration, but you can put little bits of
data there if you want.</p>

<div class="section" id="finnish-services">
<h3>Finnish services<a class="headerlink" href="#finnish-services" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">The <strong>FUNET filesender</strong> (<a class="reference external" href="https://filesender.funet.fi">https://filesender.funet.fi</a>) can share
files with others.  You log in with your Aalto account, and then you
can upload files and send a link by email.  Or, you can send an
email that allows others to upload.  Run by CSC and recommended for
sharing (instead of email).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>IDA</strong>, <strong>Etsin</strong>, and <strong>AVAA</strong> are CSC-provided services (funded
by the ministry as part of the Open Science project, ATT), which
provide some data services to researchers.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Etsin</strong> is the Finnish metadata catalog.  The intention is that
all research data eventually gets cataloged here (open or not),
but we are quite far from that goal.  Ideally, there would be
bidirectional imports to and from ACRIS (the Aalto system) and
other repositories, but it&#8217;s not there yet.  We should recommend
that you make a note of your data here, but realistically do ACRIS
and wait for a link.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>IDA</strong> is a storage service. (<a class="reference external" href="https://openscience.fi/ida">instructions</a>) It is based on iRODS, a data
management layer on top of filesystems.  Thus, you have to access
it using a special API, command line interfaces, or other tools.
Because of this, the learning curve is very steep.  Currently, we
think IDA would be good if your university doesn&#8217;t provide large
enough free, properly backed up storage that is shareable within
Finland.  For long-term public storage, Zenodo is probably overall
easier to use.  We have some practical notes on using it
<a class="reference internal" href="ida.html"><em>here</em></a>, because it takes quite a few steps to get started.</p>
<p>It is said to be a safe place to store your data, but if you read
closely a different &#8220;long-term preservation&#8221; service <a class="reference external" href="https://www.fairdata.fi/en/fairdata-pas/">is coming</a>, so IDA isn&#8217;t that.  IDA
might have a use case for confidential data which can&#8217;t leave
Finland, but it says <a class="reference external" href="https://www.fairdata.fi/en/ida/">it claims it is not suitable for such</a>.  They also say that metadata
&#8220;<a class="reference external" href="https://sui.csc.fi/web/guest/terms-of-use/-/asset_publisher/FMMBc3VntxT0/content/id/465885">shall</a>&#8221;
be added, which makes you think it is only for data which is
prepared enough for putting in Etsin.</p>
<p>If you are dealing with a large amount of data and want to use an
API to handle it, this could be good.</p>
<p>IDA is being <a class="reference external" href="https://openscience.fi/ida-renewal">renewed</a> in
2018, and will need reevaluation then.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>AVAA</strong> is basically a merging of IDA and Etsin.  You can set
some metadata in IDA so that your data is available via the web.
There are some instruction in the IDA user guide (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.fairdata.fi/en/ida/user-guide/">browser</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.fairdata.fi/en/ida/user-guide/">command line</a>).  Overall,
having to use three different services for publishing a file takes
a fair amount of work, so if you want to open data, Zenodo is
faster.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>The FSD Finnish Social Data Archive / Tietoarkisto</strong> is run from
the University of Tampere.  It is a full-service archive for social
data, so they can help in data preparation and curation..  It is one
of the few places in Finland allowed to archive personally
identifiable data.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>DMPTuuli</strong> (<a class="reference external" href="https://dmptuuli.fi">dmptuuli.fi</a>) is a service
for making data management plans.  It is primarily targeted at
funder DMPs, so it won&#8217;t help you plan your actual research (and
even for funder DMPs, you need to know what to say).  You can check
our <a class="reference internal" href="plans.html"><em>data management plans</em></a> page, including the
&#8220;emergency DMP&#8221; section.  Aalto also has a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.aalto.fi/en/services/data-management-plan-dmp">little bit of guidance</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Zenodo</strong> (<a class="reference external" href="https://zenodo.org">https://zenodo.org</a>) is a long-term data repository.  It
is the largest (thus the most stable long-term) and also has a great
user interface.  You get a DOI if you archive here.  We recommend
this service unless you have another
domain-specific repository that fits your data better.  If you
publish data here, also make a metadata entry in ACRIS (see above).</p>
<p>Zenodo is a good service, but there is little curation, so you need
to make sure that your data is described well (both in the
structured catalog information and within the data, so that it is
usable).</p>
<p>When you put data in Zenodo, also make an ACRIS dataset entry linked
with the DOI.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>EUDAT</strong> (<a class="reference external" href="https://eudat.eu">https://eudat.eu</a>) provides a lot of different services:
B2share is a lot like Zenodo, but smaller and last we checked the
user interface wasn&#8217;t as good (and it didn&#8217;t provide DOIs).  B2Drop
is a Dropbox-like file sharing service (powered by nextcloud), which
can be quite nice.  B2Find is a metadata catalog that lets you
search for data.  The other services are mostly target to other
large infrastructures.  (EUDAT will be re-evaluated in 2018)</p>

<h3>Global services (with special Aalto support)<a class="headerlink" href="#global-services-with-special-aalto-support" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Google Drive</strong> is a cloud storage solution (but you probably
already knew that...).  You can register your Aalto account as a
Google account, which gives you unlimited storage (note that this
does not mean your personal account gets unlimited... a Gsuite
account does.  This account ends when you leave Aalto, so this
should not be used for permanent storage).  You have to enable your
account using <a class="reference external" href="https://www.aalto.fi/en/services/google-drive-registration-and-closing-of-an-account">ITS instructions here</a>.
Access the Aalto Google Drive from <a class="reference external" href="https://gdrive.aalto.fi">https://gdrive.aalto.fi</a>.  This
service can be great for sharing, but because it is tied to your
Aalto account, you should not store valuable research data here.</p>
<p>Google Drive (organizations only) has a &#8220;shared drive&#8221; concept, which will allow you to
put data into groups which can easily be inherited as time goes on,
even if the original people move on.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Microsoft OneDrive</strong> is like Google Drive, and Aalto has a special
agreement.  You can find
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.aalto.fi/en/services/onedrive-quick-guide">instructions from ITS here</a>.
Theoretically, OneDrive has a higher security rating than Google
Drive, but it is still not suitable for legally confidential data.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Dropbox</strong> is like the above two.  You can find <a class="reference external" href="https://www.aalto.fi/en/services/aalto-dropbox-quick-guide">ITS instructions
here</a>.  You
can sign up using a detailed procedure there.  Again, this isn&#8217;t
suitable for confidential/personal data, and everything vanishes
once you leave Aalto.</p>

<li><strong>Github</strong> is a code-sharing and collaboration service (using git,
obviously).  If you have an open source project, this is a
well-known place to put it.  The only downside is if you have
objections to proprietary services.  Github should not be used as a
permanent archive, but there is Zenodo integration so that your code
can be archived permanently (and even has integration with the
Github &#8220;release&#8221; feature).</li>
